this is note-o-rama, a second attempt

This isn't ready for publicity yet.  Almost nothing works yet.  
For now it's only on github as my personal backup.

So far I'm only experimenting with the javascript, browser-side code.
(There will be new server-side code 
if I get around to re-writing that too; but the new client code
will probably work with the old server given a couple of changes.)
It's going to work as a javascript bookmarklet
it's going to work in all browsers.
This time it will be simple, like (old) readability.
