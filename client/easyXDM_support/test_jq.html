class="cmr-10x-x-109">Joint actions paradigmatically include two people painting a house together</span>
      <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">or lifting a heavy sofa together. What more is needed to understand what</span>
      <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">joint action is? Joint action is standardly characterised by appeal to shared</span>
      <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">intention (a technical notion) or some other ingredient distinguishing joint</span>
      <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">from individual action. By introducing the notion of a collective goal, we</span>
      <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">argue that it is possible to characterise joint action without shared intention</span>
      <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">or any other distinctive ingredient. This has implications for understanding</span>
      <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">what joint actions are and which abilities are involved in understanding or</span>
      <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">engaging in them, as well as for philosophy of action generally.</span>
