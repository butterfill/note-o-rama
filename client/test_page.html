<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >There are phenomena, call them <span

href="#Xgilbert_walking_1990">Gilbert</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgilbert_walking_1990">1990</a>). In
developmental psychology paradigm cases of joint action include two people tidying up
the toys together (<a

is. They are also supposed to be paradigm cases, and they are supposed to be cases
reflection on which could provide an intuitive understanding of what joint action is.
Given that there is some notion (at least one but not necessarily only one) an intuitive
understanding of which could be gained by reflection on these supposedly paradigm
cases, what is this notion&#8212;or, if there is more than one, what are those notions? Our
aim, broadly put, is to answer this question. (We shall gradually narrow focus in this
section and the next.)
</p><!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   The question can be constrained by noting that joint actions are the focus of a
tangle of scientific and philosophical questions. Psychologically we want to know which
mechanisms make it possible to engage in and understand different sorts of joint action
                                                                                

                                                                                
(<a 
href="#Xvesper_minimal_2010">Vesper et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvesper_minimal_2010">2010</a>). Developmentally we want to know when joint action emerges,
what it presupposes and whether abilities to engage in it somehow facilitate
socio-cognitive, pragmatic or symbolic development (<a 
href="#XMoll:2007gu">Moll &amp; Tomasello</a>&#x00A0;<a

href="#XBrownell:2006gu">Brownell et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBrownell:2006gu">2006</a>). Conceptually, we want a principled way of
distinguishing joint from individual actions which supports investigation of mechanisms
and development (<a 
href="#XBratman:2009lv">Bratman</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBratman:2009lv">2009</a>), plus a formal account of how practical reasoning for
joint action differs (if at all) from individual practical reasoning (<a 
href="#XSugden:2000mw">Sugden</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSugden:2000mw">2000</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGold:2007zd">Gold &amp;
Sugden</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGold:2007zd">2007</a>). Phenomenologically we want to characterise what (if anything) is special
about experiences of action and agency when the actions are joint actions
(<a 
href="#XPacherie:2010fk">Pacherie</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XPacherie:2010fk">2010</a>). Metaphysically we want to know what kinds of entities and
structures are implied by the recognition that some actions are joint actions
(<a 
href="#XGilbert:1992rs">Gilbert</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGilbert:1992rs">1992</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSearle:1994lb">Searle</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSearle:1994lb">1994</a>). And normatively we want to know what kinds of
commitments (if any) are imposed on participants in joint actions or how these
commitments arise (<a 
href="#XRoth:2004ki">Roth</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XRoth:2004ki">2004</a>).
</p><!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   These questions provide one possible motive for asking our question about
the nature of joint action. Perhaps better understanding the nature of joint
action will facilitate progress with the tangle of philosophical and scientific
questions about it. Accordingly we impose a further constraint on acceptable
answers to our question about the nature of joint action. Any answer must
be at least potentially relevant to the tangle of scientific and philosophical
questions commonly taken to be questions about joint action. As we shall
see (in section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-50004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: section_first_objection --></a> on page&#x00A0;<span class="pageref"><a 
href="#x1-50004"><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span></a></span>), this constraint distinguishes our project from
narrowly semantic and conceptual projects (which is not to say that there is
anything wrong with those projects, only that they are not subject to the same
constraints).
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   To recap, we assume that there is a notion (at least one, but not necessarily only
one) which is both (a) such that an implicit conception of it is available through
reflection on a collection of supposedly paradigm cases including all or many of those
listed in our opening paragraph and also (b) central to a tangle of philosophical and
scientific questions commonly taken to be questions about joint action. By stipulation,
and in line with much of the literature, we call any such notion a notion of <span 
class="cmti-12">joint action</span>.
Our question is, What is that notion or, in case there is more than one, what are those
notions?

<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >Our question is not new. According to Gilbert:
      </p><div class="quote">
                                                                                

                                                                                
      <!--l. 139--><p class="noindent" >&#8216;The  key  question  in  the  philosophy  of  collective  action  is  simply
      ...  under  what  conditions  are  two  or  more  people  doing  something
      together?&#8217; (<a 
href="#XGilbert:2010fk">Gilbert</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGilbert:2010fk">2010</a>, p.&#x00A0;67)</p></div>
<!--l. 142--><p class="noindent" >While acknowledging Gilbert&#8217;s sustained attempt to elaborate and answer this
question, we shall distance ourselves from a potentially puzzling feature of
this passage, one which reflects an attitude widespread among researchers in
this area. Gilbert takes the question to be a question in &#8216;the philosophy of
collective action.&#8217; (Since differences in terminology do not appear to mark
explicit theoretical differences, we take &#8216;collective action&#8217; to be another term for
joint action.) Why think there is any such thing as the philosophy of collective
action?
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   For comparison, consider the claim that there is a philosophy of feline action. There
are two sorts of objection to this claim. One would be that cats are not agents and so
there is no such thing as feline action. Another would allow that there are
feline actions but deny that they are associated with philosophical questions
significantly distinct from those concerning action generally; feline actions are
simply actions performed by cats, end of (philosophical) story. Take this second
sort of objection and consider a parallel for the assumption, made by Gilbert
and others, that there is a philosophy of joint action. The objection would be
that joint actions do not raise philosophical questions significantly distinct
from those raised by actions generally. Just as agents&#8217; felinity might make no
difference, philosophically speaking, so also their numbering more than one may
be irrelevant. If this were right, the correct approach to our question about
joint action would be deflationary. Instead of trying to identify conditions,
necessary or sufficient, for something to be a joint action, we should instead
attempt to show that a notion of joint action is already contained in a notion of
action.
</p><!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >   Can such a deflationary approach be dismissed at the outset? It is true, of course,
that philosophical claims about action tend to apply directly only to actions with one
agent and cannot straightforwardly be generalised to actions with two or more agents
(examples are discussed below). But since this historical fact may reflect a blind-spot
rather than an insight, it alone should not persuade us that notions of joint action
deserve a philosophy of their own.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >   It is also true that existing accounts of joint action are not deflationary. It has
generally been assumed by those attempting to characterise joint action that all joint
action necessarily and constitutively involves an ingredient not already needed for
characterising individual action. Call any such thing a <span 
class="cmti-12">distinctive ingredient</span>.  The
distinctive ingredient is often held to be shared intention, collective intention or
we-intention. For instance:
      </p><div class="quote">

href="#XTollefsen:2005vh">Tollefsen</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XTollefsen:2005vh">2005</a>). In all cases, the distinctive
ingredient is supposed to stand to joint action roughly as an individual intention
stands to an ordinary action. That is, it is supposed to coordinate two or more
agents&#8217; actions and represent a goal or end to which these actions are directed.
Beyond this there is much divergence on what the distinctive ingredient of joint
action is. Some hold that it differs from ordinary intention with respect to
the attitude involved (<a 
href="#XSearle:1990em">Searle</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSearle:1990em">1990</a>). Others have explored the notion that
it differs from ordinary intention with respect to its subject, which is plural
(<a 
href="#XGilbert:1992rs">Gilbert</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGilbert:1992rs">1992</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhelm_plural_2008">Helm</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhelm_plural_2008">2008</a>), or that it differs from ordinary intention in the way it
arises, namely through team reasoning (<a 
href="#XGold:2007zd">Gold &amp; Sugden</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGold:2007zd">2007</a>), or that it involves
distinctive obligations or commitments to others (<a 
href="#XGilbert:1992rs">Gilbert</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGilbert:1992rs">1992</a>; <a 
href="#XRoth:2004ki">Roth</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XRoth:2004ki">2004</a>).
Opposing all such views, <a 
href="#XBratman:1992mi">Bratman</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XBratman:1992mi">1992</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBratman:2009lv">2009</a>) argues that the distinctive
ingredient, which he calls &#8216;shared intention&#8217;, can be realised by multiple ordinary
individual intentions and other attitudes whose contents interlock in a distinctive
way.
</p><!--l. 191--><p class="indent" >   Is there a notion of joint action that can be characterised without using any
distinctive ingredients at all? A deflationary approach to joint action aims to show that
there is.
</p><!--l. 194--><p class="indent" >   To clarify what the deflationary approach amounts to let us distinguish two extreme
positions. The strong deflationist says that no notion of joint action is such that
characterising it requires any ingredient not already involved in characterising
action generally. The strong anti-deflationist says, conversely, that all notions of
joint action are such that characterising them requires appeal to a distinctive
ingredient. Those philosophers who insist that all joint action involves shared
intention thereby endorse the strong anti-deflationist&#8217;s position. Philosophers
who claim, more modestly, that shared intention or some other distinctive
ingredient is necessary to characterise a notion of joint action thereby reject
the strong deflationist&#8217;s position; but they need not be committed to strong
anti-deflationism unless they also hold that there is just one notion of joint action. For
our part, we are neutral on whether there are notions of joint action which cannot
be characterised without using distinctive ingredients. Our concern is with a
position that is modestly deflationary. The question for this paper is whether
there is <span 
class="cmti-12">a </span>notion of joint action which can be characterised using no distinctive
ingredient&#8212;that is, using no ingredient not already needed in characterising individual
action.
</p><!--l. 204--><p class="indent" >   To our knowledge only one philosopher has even raised this question in print (we
                                                                                

                                                                                
are, however, indebted to many for discussion). Chant considers the possibility that
joint actions&#8212;she calls them &#8216;collective actions&#8217;&#8212;may be composed of non-joint
actions and that relations between joint actions and their constituent actions
may be &#8216;analogous&#8217; to relations between complex non-joint actions and their
constituent actions (<a 
href="#Xchant_unintentional_2007">Chant</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xchant_unintentional_2007">2007</a>, p.&#x00A0;254). While there are differences between
Chant&#8217;s position and ours, this suggests she is sympathetic to the idea that
no distinctive ingredients are needed to characterise a notion of joint action.
Other than Chant, it is true that several authors have used terms such as
&#8216;joint action&#8217; for notions which they characterise without using distinctive
ingredients (e.g.&#x00A0;<a

But note that these authors were not attempting to engage directly with the
tangle of philosophical and scientific questions mentioned above. Nor are their
accounts presented as characterising notions of joint action in our sense (see
p.&#x00A0;<span class="pageref"><a

deflationary approach, are not incompatible with strong anti-deflationism because
they are not offering competing accounts of any phenomena philosophers have
attempted to characterise in terms of shared intention or other distinctive
ingredients.
</p><!--l. 216--><p class="indent" >   Why pursue a deflationary approach? Naturally part of our motivation is to
demystify joint action. But since we are agnostic concerning strong deflationism, we
cannot claim that the deflationary approach, even if successful, will resolve all
philosophical issues about joint action. In fact, one good reason for pursuing the
deflationary approach is to better understand shared intention. On the leading
accounts, shared intentions involve individual intentions about a joint action
(e.g.&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBratman:1993je">Bratman</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBratman:1993je">1993</a>). Since the contents of these individual intentions cannot without
circularity all concern shared intentional actions as such (<a 
href="#XSearle:1990em">Searle</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSearle:1990em">1990</a>, p. 95),
characterising shared intention would require identifying a notion of joint action
that can be characterised without appeal to shared intention (<a 
href="#Xpetersson_collectivity_2007">Petersson</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xpetersson_collectivity_2007">2007</a>;
<a 
href="#XBratman:2009lv">Bratman</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBratman:2009lv">2009</a>, p. 163). The deflationary approach, if successful, would enable us to
meet this requirement.
</p><!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >   On the motivation for pursuing a deflationary approach, we also note
that some researchers have raised the possibility of joint action without
shared intention (e.g.&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvesper_minimal_2010">Vesper et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvesper_minimal_2010">2010</a>). Others, such as Bratman,
are even committed to there being joint actions not involving shared
intention.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-3001f1"></a>
Given the sorts of knowledge requirement generally associated with shared
intention,<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3002f2"></a>
this commitment is also a consequence of <a 
href="#Xschmidt_understanding_2010">Schmidt et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#8217;s (<a 
href="#Xschmidt_understanding_2010">2010</a>, p. 7) claim
that &#8216;many joint actions occur spontaneously or automatically without the
participants being consciously aware of their coordination with each other.&#8217;
                                                                                

                                                                                
A deflationary approach to joint action, if successful, would vindicate these
commitments.
</p><!--l. 250--><p class="indent" >   Here is one final reason for interest in a deflationary approach to joint action. In
everyday life we regularly think and talk about actions involving two or more agents.
Asked about the concert, we might report that after some solo numbers, Emily sang a
duet with Lyra. Catching sight of wedding celebrations outside a church, we might
notice that the bride and groom are sawing through a log with a two-handled saw. This
duet and this sawing are distinct from otherwise similar cases in which the same agents
are each acting alone&#8212;cases in which, say, the singers are competing for attention or the
bride and groom are each individually sawing through two logs. Everyday thinking
about action appears to respect this distinction. So we can think and talk
about joint actions involving two or more agents as well as individual actions
involving just one. Are these distinct abilities? For those who already have number
concepts, does an ability to think or talk about joint actions as such necessarily
require conceptual sophistication not already required for thinking or talking
about actions involving just one agent? The success of a deflationary approach
would (nondeductively) support a negative answer to this question. Given
either moderate or strong deflationism, it is plausible that those capable of
thinking about action generally are thereby already equipped to think about joint
action.
</p><!--l. 266--><p class="indent" >   A deflationary approach to joint action, if successful, will show that an adequate
philosophical account of action already contains an account of joint action.
Understanding joint action, or at least understanding one notion of it, does not require
novel kinds of agent, commitment or attitude, or even novel structures of commitments
or attitudes. It is enough to be able to count and to know what an action
is.

analogy, consider feline action again. How can we define feline action? This is not a deep
question. A feline action is simply an action performed by one or more cats. Similarly,
the simple definition says that a joint action is an action with two or more
agents, as contrasted with an individual action which is an action with a single

href="#XDavidson:1971fz">1971</a>, p.&#x00A0;49). (This notion has been clarified and refined
by <a 
href="#Xhornsby_actions_1980">Hornsby</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xhornsby_actions_1980">1980</a>) and others, but, as we shall explain, the refinements will not directly
affect our argument.) Unless the existence of joint action can be ruled out
in advance, this definition is insufficiently general because it applies only to
actions with one agent. We can avoid or at least postpone the tricky question of
how this definition should be generalised by noting that Davidson also holds
that the only actions which are primitive are &#8216;mere movements of the body&#8217;
(<a 
href="#XDavidson:1971fz">Davidson</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XDavidson:1971fz">1971</a>, p.&#x00A0;59). So on his view movements of the body are all the actions
there are. To illustrate, suppose that Ahmed unlocks a door by turning a key,
which he in turn achieves by moving his fingers. On Davidson&#8217;s view, Ahmed&#8217;s
door unlocking action is his finger moving action. To nonphilosophers this
view has sometimes seemed baffling but it is in some ways intuitive. Ahmed&#8217;s
action, the difference that his agency makes in the world, is not constituted
by the lock&#8217;s movement but only by the movements of his own body (or, on
developments of Davidson&#8217;s view, by Ahmed&#8217;s trying to move his body&#8212;see
below). Whether the lock unlocks or not depends on things which Ahmed cannot
directly influence; it is at most the movements of his body which are under his
control when he acts. Since his action causes the door to unlock, we can <span 
class="cmti-12">describe</span>
Ahmed&#8217;s action by saying that he unlocks the door. But this doesn&#8217;t mean
that changes in the lock are <span 
class="cmti-12">parts </span>of his action, only that they are among its
effects.
</p><!--l. 330--><p class="indent" >   This view, together with some plausible assumptions, implies that in many or all
supposedly paradigm cases of joint action, no action has two or more agents and
so there is no joint action after all. Briefly, this is because there is no bodily
movement with more than one agent. To illustrate, take the case where two people,
acting on a shared intention, pull levers in sequence to make a puppet sing
                                                                                

                                                                                
(<a 
href="#XBrownell:2006gu">Brownell et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBrownell:2006gu">2006</a>). Call them Ayesha and Pandora. Each agent grasps
a distinct lever with her own hand and moves her own torso, shoulder and
arm in pulling it. Furthermore, no other bodily movement involving these
agents is among the causes of the puppet&#8217;s singing. Suppose that all actions are
primitive and that all primitive actions are bodily movements, as Davidson
claims. Then among the actions which together result in the puppet singing
there is none of which both Ayesha and Pandora are agents. Given the simple
definition, it follows that their making the puppet sing together was not a joint
action.
</p><!--l. 342--><p class="indent" >   Is this too quick? Suppose that some composite of Ayesha&#8217;s and Pandora&#8217;s
lever-pulling actions is an event. If this event were an action, it would have both Ayesha
and Pandora as agents and so would count as a joint action on the simple definition.
But could any such event be an action? To see whether it could, consider a parallel
scenario, one that is as similar as possible except that a single agent, Coralie, makes the
puppet sing by pulling both levers herself. Let us stipulate that Coralie&#8217;s pulling of what
was formerly Ayesha&#8217;s lever is an action, and similarly for Coralie&#8217;s pulling of Pandora&#8217;s
lever; this is surely possible even if there are other possible cases in which
Coralie&#8217;s pullings would together comprise a single action without either pulling
individually being an action. Unless there are three actions in this scenario, Coralie&#8217;s
two pullings plus their composite, we should not allow that there are three
actions in the original scenario either. Now on some views of action it is possible
that in Coralie&#8217;s making the puppet sing there are indeed three (or more)
actions. But, given Davidson&#8217;s claims, the composite of Coralie&#8217;s two pullings is
not an action. This is because the event is not primitive: it consists of two
actions and nothing else and so, trivially, it can be analysed in terms of these
actions. We should therefore draw the same conclusion about the composite of
Ayesha&#8217;s and Pandora&#8217;s pullings: it is not an action. So on Davidson&#8217;s view,
the events (if any) which involve both Ayesha and Pandora as agents are not
actions.

Given this definition, if Davidson&#8217;s claims (or some variation of them&#8212;see below) are

all.
</p><!--l. 372--><p class="indent" >   Note that the above argument works irrespectively of whether Ayesha and Pandora
have a shared intention. We could have stipulated that they engage in team reasoning,

other&#8217;s intentions that they make the puppet sing in accordance with, and
because of, meshing subplans of their intentions that they make the puppet sing.

as in many others, no bodily movements which are actions need have two or more
agents. Given the premises above, it follows that there are no actions with more than
one agent in any of these cases. And on the simple definition of joint action this

</p><!--l. 424--><p class="indent" >   The second premise of the argument can be weakened. Some philosophers broadly in
agreement with Davidson reject the claim that all actions are primitive in his sense but
allow that all actions are primitive in some other sense (the term &#8216;basic&#8217; is now more
common than &#8216;primitive&#8217;), and some also hold that primitive actions are tryings rather
than bodily movements (e.g.&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhornsby_actions_1980">Hornsby</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhornsby_actions_1980">1980</a>). If the above argument works given
Davidson&#8217;s position it also works given such revisions to the position. In fact, the
argument works given any position which respects two constraints: first, no action
involves the movements of things other than the agent&#8217;s or agents&#8217; bodies; and, second,
an event comprising two or more actions and nothing else is not itself an action.
Whether Ayesha&#8217;s pulling of the lever was a bodily movement, a trying or anything
else which stops short of including the puppet&#8217;s singing, the action was hers
alone.
</p><!--l. 430--><p class="indent" >   Note that our argument does not depend on the assumptions that all primitive actions

Our point is that <span

a theoretically significant cluster of cases. Our claim is only that, given some

actions.

see why, consider two principles. First, no event causes itself. Second, where
one event causes another, the first event also causes any event which is part
of the second (this principle may be restricted in ways which do not affect
its application here). These principles jointly imply that the toppling of the

complications not relevant for present purposes): for any event, whether or not it is an

it (<a 
href="#Xpietroski_actions_1998">1998</a>, p.&#x00A0;82). This provides an attenuated sense in which an individual
can be an agent of an event even if the event is not an action. (Note that
since every event grounds itself, the proposal incorporates prior truths about
agency.)

exactly it is) grounds an event that starts with her action and ends with the
puppet singing. If so, her actions ground this event and she is an agent of
it.

purposes.

cases involving just one agent. To get around this obstacle we first have to generalise his

that more than one set of actions may ground an event. This can be done as
follows:
      </p><div class="quote">
      <!--l. 546--><p class="noindent" >For an individual to be among the agents of an event is for there to be

</p><!--l. 551--><p class="indent" >   How does this proposal apply to Ayesha and Pandora&#8217;s making the puppet sing?
Consider the whole episode, the episode encompassing their two pulling actions and the
puppet&#8217;s singing. Each pulling involves an action of which Ayesha or Pandora is an
agent and these two pullings together ground the whole episode. So, given the
above proposal about agency, Ayesha and Pandora are agents of the whole
episode.
</p><!--l. 557--><p class="indent" >   The proposal about agency is also consistent with the view that in paradigm
cases of joint action, such as two people&#8217;s painting a house together, there
are events with two or more agents. The proposal thus allows us to combine
two claims about supposedly paradigm cases of joint action: first, that they
do not involve <span 
class="cmti-12">actions </span>with more than one agent (as standard views about
action require); and, second, that they do involve <span 
class="cmti-12">events </span>with more than one
agent.
</p><!--l. 560--><p class="indent" >   Accordingly one way of avoiding the first objection to the simple definition of joint
action is to revise it in line with this proposal. On the revised simple definition, a
joint action is an event grounded by the actions of two or more agents. The

of an event together imply that a joint action is an event with two or more
agents.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 579--><p class="noindent" >The revised simple definition of joint action clearly avoids the first objection, for it no
longer fails to classify paradigm cases as joint actions. But in revising the simple
definition to avoid this objection we have made ourselves open to a converse objection.
                                                                                

                                                                                
As we shall see, whereas the original simple definition was too narrow, the revised
definition appears to be too broad, classifying as joint actions events which arguably
should not be so classified.
</p><!--l. 585--><p class="indent" >   Here is an episode we shall use to explain this objection. Nora and Olive killed Fred.
Each fired a shot. Neither shot was individually fatal but together they were deadly. An
ambulance arrived on the scene almost at once but Fred didn&#8217;t make it to the
hospital.
</p><!--l. 591--><p class="indent" >   Consider the whole episode starting with the shootings and ending with Fred&#8217;s
death. This event is grounded by Nora&#8217;s shooting and Olive&#8217;s shooting. So given the
revised simple definition the whole episode is a joint action. Now suppose that Nora and
Olive have no knowledge of each other, nor of each other&#8217;s actions, and that their efforts
are entirely uncoordinated. We might even suppose that Nora and Olive are so
antagonistic to each other that they would, if either knew the other&#8217;s location, turn
their guns on each other. The event of their killing Fred is nevertheless a joint action
on the revised simple definition. But unless one thinks of the central event
of <span 
class="cmti-12">Reservoir Dogs </span>(<a 
href="#XTarantino:1992fk">Tarantino</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XTarantino:1992fk">1992</a>) as a joint action, this is likely to seem
counterintuitive.
</p><!--l. 600--><p class="indent" >   The problem for the revised simple definition is general. Whenever two or more
agents&#8217; actions have a common effect and there is an event comprising the
actions and their common effect, the actions will ground this event. And on the
revised simple definition this is sufficient for the event to be a joint action.
This makes it plausible that the revised simple definition does not identify a
notion of joint action. For the notion identified by the revised simple definition
seems not to be one available through reflection on supposedly paradigm cases.
Nor does this notion seem to be central to the tangle of philosophical and
scientific questions about joint action. For instance, the hypothesis that joint
action grounds cognition (<a 
href="#XKnoblich:2006bn">Knoblich &amp; Sebanz</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKnoblich:2006bn">2006</a>, p.&#x00A0;103) is clearly not a
hypothesis about the kind of joint action (if any) exemplified by uncoordinated joint
shootings.
</p><!--l. 609--><p class="indent" >   This objection to the revised simple definition of joint action is equally an objection
to the above proposal about agency. According to that proposal, where some actions
ground an event, the agents of the actions are agents of the event (see section <a 
href="#x1-60005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: section_grounding --></a>).
On this proposal, Nora and Olive would be agents of an event which starts
with their shooting actions and ends with Fred&#8217;s death. This is an objection
because the proposal was not supposed to introduce a merely technical notion of
agency but one rooted in everyday thinking about action (<a 
href="#Xpietroski_actions_1998">Pietroski</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xpietroski_actions_1998">1998</a>,
pp.&#x00A0;80-1). The problem we face, then, is not just about joint action. It is a more
general problem about it is is for individuals to be agents of events other than
actions.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

(modestly) deflationary approach to joint action is viable. In what follows we therefore
offer ways of narrowing the revised simple definition.

<!--l. 633--><p class="noindent" >At this point we need a brief detour to fix terminology. The term &#8216;goal&#8217; has been used
both for outcomes (as in &#8216;the goal of our struggles&#8217;) and, perhaps improperly, for
psychological states of agents (it is in this sense that agents&#8217; goals might cause their
actions). We use &#8216;goal&#8217; in the former sense only. A <span 
class="cmti-12">goal </span>is an outcome to which actions
are, or might be, directed. An intention is not a goal but a <span 
class="cmti-12">goal-state</span>&#8212;a state of an
agent which represents a goal and which is (or could be) related to one or more of the
agent&#8217;s actions in such a way that these actions are (or would be) directed
to that goal. From the fact that an action is directed to a particular goal it
does not follow that the agent of the action has a goal-state representing this
goal and in virtue of which the action is directed to that goal. It doesn&#8217;t even
follow that the agent has any goal-states at all if, as some have argued, it is
possible to understand what it is for an action to be directed to a goal without
appeal to goal-states (e.g.&#x00A0;<a

detour.
</p><!--l. 649--><p class="indent" >   On the revised simple definition, a joint action is an event grounded by the actions
of two or more agents (see section&#x00A0;<a

class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span></a></span>). In the previous section we encountered
an objection to this definition. Can the definition be fixed? All of the cases of joint
action that serve as paradigms in philosophy or psychology are <span 
class="cmti-12">goal-directed joint</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">actions</span>. That is, they are cases where the event taken as a whole is directed to a goal.
To illustrate, return to Ayesha and Pandora&#8217;s pulling handles in sequence to make a
dog-puppet sing. Ayesha, asked about their action, might insist, &#8216;The goal of our
actions was not to turn the light on but to make the puppet sing.&#8217; (Note that
this sentence concerns the goal of an action and does not explicitly mention
intentions.) What is it for the goal of their actions to be that of making the
puppet sing? Among all the actual and possible outcomes of their actions, what
distinguishes this as the goal to which their action was directed? More generally, what
is the relation between a joint action and the goal (or goals) to which it is
directed?
</p><!--l. 662--><p class="indent" >   In answering this question it is tempting to appeal to shared intention. A shared
intention functions to coordinate agents&#8217; contributions and involves states which
represent an outcome. Where joint action involves shared intention, the goal represented
by the shared intention coordinating the joint action is the goal to which the joint
action is directed. (Here and in what follows we simplify exposition by writing as if no
action were directed to more than one goal.) Shared intention, then, makes
                                                                                

                                                                                
available a possible explanation of how a joint action is related to the goal to
which it is directed. But, as explained above (in section <a 
href="#x1-30002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: section_deflationary --></a>), our aim is to avoid
appeal to shared intention or other distinctive ingredients in characterising joint
action. Is there a way to understand how joint actions can be goal-directed
which does not involve shared intention? We shall show that there is with
a series of increasingly elaborate notions. Each notion describes a relation
between multiple agents&#8217; actions and an outcome to which those actions are
directed.

(These intentions ensure that it is possible for both communists to succeed in painting
the bridge, as well as for either of them to succeed alone.) Because the bridge is large
and they start from different ends, the two communists have no idea of each other&#8217;s
involvement until they meet in the middle. Nor did they expect that anyone else would
be involved in painting the bridge red. On almost any account, this implies that they
were not acting on a shared intention. Despite this, they both succeed in painting the
bridge red. As this illustration suggests, it is possible for two or more agents&#8217;
actions to have a distributive goal without the agents having any knowledge
of, or intentions about, each other, and without the agents having a shared
intention.
</p><!--l. 706--><p class="indent" >   As already mentioned, for two or more agents&#8217; actions to have a distributive goal it
is necessary that each agent&#8217;s actions are related to the goal in a way that allows all

not have been met if the bridge painters had each intended that she paint
the bridge red. Although this intention would have ensured that there was a
single goal&#8212;the bridge&#8217;s being painted red&#8212;to which each agent&#8217;s actions
were directed, it is arguable that neither agent&#8217;s intention would have been be
fulfilled because neither was the sole painter. Distributive goals require intentions
(or other ways of relating actions to goals) that are compatible with others&#8217;
                                                                                

                                                                                
involvement. This requirement is met by intentions which are explicitly neutral
concerning others&#8217; success. For example, one of the bridge painters might have
intended that she paint the bridge either alone or with others. As illustrated
in the above example, the requirement is also met by some intentions whose
contents do not explicitly specify agents, such as intentions to act in ways that

</p><!--l. 715--><p class="indent" >   Note that multiple agents&#8217; actions do not have a distributive goal just in virtue of
their actions being directed to similar outcomes. In an example from Searle (<a

shelter. Suppose that each visitor&#8217;s action is directed to a similar but distinct
outcome, namely her own arrival at the shelter. These outcomes are so similar that
each visitor could describe the outcome to which her actions are directed in
the same words (&#8216;I reach the shelter&#8217;). Despite this, they are clearly distinct
outcomes. One could occur while another does not; one park visitor might make it
to the shelter while another is trapped under a falling tree. If each visitor&#8217;s
actions are directed only to her own arrival at the shelter, the visitors&#8217; actions
lack a distributive goal just because there is no outcome to which they are
all directed. If, alternatively, each visitor&#8217;s actions had been directed to their
collective arrival at the shelter, then their actions would have had a distributive
goal.
</p><!--l. 725--><p class="indent" >   To recap, our overall aim is to characterise a notion of joint action without appeal to

href="#x1-30002"><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span></a></span> above). Our current candidate characterisation is the revised simple
definition. On this definition, a joint action is an event grounded by the actions of two
or more agents (see section <a 
href="#x1-60005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: section_revised_simple_definition --></a>). Unfortunately this definition is too broad. Many events
which are perhaps not intuitively joint actions and apparently not relevant to
philosophical or scientific questions about joint action, such as Nora and Olive&#8217;s killing
of Fred, would in fact be joint actions if we accepted this definition (see section <a 
href="#x1-70006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: section_second_objection --></a>). To
avoid this problem we are currently exploring how the definition might be
narrowed to goal-directed joint action. The question of detail is how to explain the
relation between a joint action and its goal without appeal to shared intention or
any other distinctive ingredient. The notion of a distributive goal suggests
one candidate answer to this question. Where multiple agents&#8217; actions have a
distributive goal there is a sense in which their actions are directed to that
goal.
</p><!--l. 738--><p class="indent" >   Is this answer adequate? Would invoking distributive goals enable us to suitably
narrow the definition of joint action? In their killing of Fred, Nora and Olive&#8217;s actions
might have a distributive goal. After all, each agent&#8217;s actions are individually directed
to Fred&#8217;s death and it is consistent with the stipulations made about this scenario that
                                                                                

                                                                                
these goal relations are compatible in the sense that both agents could succeed together
(for instance the goal relations might hold in virtue of Nora and Olive each acting on an
intention that her shooting ground or partially ground Fred&#8217;s killing). So if we
were to further revise the simple definition of joint action by invoking the
notion of a distributive goal, we would barely improve on the revised simple
definition.
</p><!--l. 749--><p class="indent" >   Where multiple agents&#8217; actions have a distributive goal, it is true that there is a
sense in which their actions are directed to a goal, but this may amount only to each
agent&#8217;s actions being individually directed to that goal. To identify a notion of joint
action we need a notion richer than that of a distributive goal, one that relates joint
actions to goals without this being only a matter of each agent&#8217;s actions being
individually directed to the goal.

<!--l. 760--><p class="noindent" >Let an outcome, possible or actual, be a <span 
class="cmti-12">collective goal  </span>of a joint action, or of any
collection of goal-directed actions, where three conditions are met: (a) this outcome is a
distributive goal of the actions; (b) the actions are coordinated; and (c) coordination of
this type would normally facilitate occurrences of outcomes of this type. Examples of
actions that typically have collective goals include two people jointly sawing a log with a
two-handled saw and three people jointly lifting a heavy table. The communist bridge
painters (from section <a 
href="#x1-90008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: section_distributive_goals --></a>) are different: their actions do not have a collective goal because
they are not coordinated.
</p><!--l. 768--><p class="indent" >   The notion of a collective goal assumes that of coordination. This should be
understood in a broad sense. When two agents between them lift a heavy block by
means of each agent pulling on either end of a rope connected to the block via a system
of pulleys, their pullings count as coordinated in this broad sense. In this case, the
agents&#8217; actions are coordinated by a mechanism in their environment, the rope,
and not necessarily by any psychological mechanism. By invoking a broad
notion of coordination and invoking coordination of actions rather than of
agents, the definition of collective goal avoids direct appeal to psychological
states.
</p><!--l. 775--><p class="indent" >   This is not to say that collective goals never involve psychological states. In fact, one
way for several actions to have a collective goal is for their agents to be acting on a
shared intention; a shared intention supplies the required coordination. Another way
for some actions to have a collective goal is for their agents to be acting on
the basis of team reasoning, where they have a common way of framing their
decisions.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

But these are not the only ways in which actions can have a collective goal. The
coordination required for actions to have a collective goal may in some cases

href="#XKnoblich:2010fk">Knoblich et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a

properties of agents&#8217; bodies (e.g.&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xschmidt_richardons:_2008">Schmidt &amp; Richardson</a>&#x00A0;<a

conjecture based on work with bees and ants, in some cases the coordination

</p><!--l. 804--><p class="indent" >   In characterising collective goals we have appealed to facts about what
would <span 
class="cmti-12">normally </span>happen (in the third clause, (c), above). The relevant notion of
normal paradigmatically features in statements like <span 
class="cmti-12">Birds can normally fly</span>. This
notion is arguably teleological; certainly it is not straightforwardly statistical or
normative.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn9x0" id="fn9x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">9</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-10002f9"></a>
Conceptually it would be simpler to characterise collective goals by appeal only to what
actually happens&#8212;that is, to replace the third clause with the requirement
that the coordination actually facilitate the occurrence of the goal-outcome.
Why is the appeal to what would normally happen necessary? Consider a case
in which two agents&#8217; actions do have a collective goal and coordination of
their actions facilitates the goal-outcome&#8217;s occurrence: John and Anika fell
a tree using a two-handled saw. Now imagine a case which is as similar as
possible to this one except that John becomes exhausted and they have to
give up half way through. In this modified case the coordination of John&#8217;s
and Anika&#8217;s actions does not facilitate the occurrence of the outcome (the
felling of the tree). This is simply because the outcome does not occur. But the
differences between the two cases are not the sorts of difference that generally
determine facts about which goals an action is directed to. Whether actions
succeed or fail does not generally play any role in determining what their goals
were. So it seems we must allow that agents&#8217; actions can have collective goals
even where they fail. This is one reason for appealing to what would normally
happen in characterising collective goals. A second, more direct but less obvious
reason involves external factors which render coordination inefficacious. For an
illustration, suppose that Isabel and Rudi are in the habit of lifting heavy
blocks by each pulling on a handle which is linked to the block by an intricate
system of ropes and pulleys. Normally and on nearly all occasions either could
lift any of the blocks alone but, providing their pullings are coordinated, the
task is easier when done jointly; and no matter how uncoordinated they are,
the way the ropes are arranged means that it is never normally harder for
them to lift a block jointly than alone. Normally, then, coordination facilitates
the blocks being lifted. On one exceptional occasion Hannes, a third person,
intervenes. Hannes dislikes coordination between people and so, seeing the
coordination of Isabel&#8217;s and Rudi&#8217;s actions, he grabs a rope and attempts to
                                                                                

                                                                                
prevent the block being lifted. Although Hannes fails, he does make the joint
lifting harder than it would have been for either Isabel or Rudi to lift the block
alone. So in this exceptional case the coordination of their actions actually
hinders rather than facilitates the blocks being lifted: had their actions not been
coordinated, it would have been easier for them to lift the block. But this case, where
Hannes intervenes, does not differ from the normal cases in ways that are
relevant to facts about the goals of the agents&#8217; actions. For this reason it seems
that we must allow that Isabel&#8217;s and Rudi&#8217;s actions have a collective goal in
the case where Hannes intervenes as well as in the normal cases. This is why
appeal to what would normally happen is necessary in characterising collective
goals.
</p><!--l. 833--><p class="indent" >   The word &#8216;collective&#8217; in &#8216;collective goal&#8217; should not be understood to imply
that the agents involved constitute a collective in any social sense. Nor
does having a collective goal imply that the agents think of themselves as
having a collective goal. The use of &#8216;collective&#8217; and &#8216;distributive&#8217; reflects
(but does not exactly match) the use of these terms in literature on plural

<!--l. 857--><p class="noindent" >How is the notion of a collective goal relevant to our search for a modestly deflationary
characterisation of joint action? Recall that we are attempting to overcome an objection
to the revised simple definition of joint action. According to this definition, a joint
action is an event grounded by the actions of two or more agents (see section <a 
href="#x1-60005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: section_revised_simple_definition --></a>). The
objection was that the definition is too broad (see section <a 
href="#x1-70006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: section_second_objection --></a>). To overcome the objection
we are trying to narrow the definition to goal-directed joint action. The issue is how
to explicate the metaphor of goal-directedness for the case of joint action. A
natural way to do this as the literature now stands would be appeal to shared
intention. But we aim to avoid appealing to shared intention because doing so
                                                                                

                                                                                
would require abandoning our deflationary aims (see section <a 
href="#x1-30002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: section_deflationary --></a>). The notion
of a collective goal provides an alternative way to fill out the metaphor of
goal-directedness.
</p><!--l. 870--><p class="indent" >   Here, then, is our penultimate attempt to characterise a notion of joint
action:

      <!--l. 873--><p class="noindent" >A joint action is an event grounded by two or more agents&#8217; actions
      where all the actions taken together have a collective goal.</p></div>
<!--l. 878--><p class="noindent" >It remains to consider whether this definition succeeds in capturing a notion of
joint action, and whether the definition is really deflationary. We shall start
with the second question because answering it will help with answering the
first.
</p><!--l. 881--><p class="indent" >   Is the above definition really deflationary? To show that it is we need to show that
the notion of a collective goal is not a distinctive ingredient. That is, we need to show
that this notion also has application in characterising individual action, not just joint
action. In discussing collective goals we have so far considered only cases involving two
or more agents. But several actions can have a collective goal even if they
are all actions of a single agent. And the notion of a collective goal is also
relevant to answering at least one question about the actions of individual
agents.
</p><!--l. 888--><p class="indent" >   Before introducing this question let us return to the idea that, in an attenuated
sense of agency, it is possible for individuals to be agents of events which are not
actions. We first attempted to explain this possibility by appeal to the idea that actions
can ground larger events. On the proposal we considered (p.&#x00A0;<span class="pageref"><a 
href="#x1-60005"><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">§</span></a></span> above), where some
actions ground an event the agents of those actions are agents of the event. This
proposal turned out to be too broad (see section <a 
href="#x1-70006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: section_second_objection --></a>). The notion of a collective goal
enables us to improve it:
      </p><div class="quote">
      <!--l. 897--><p class="noindent" >For an individual to be among the agents of an event is for there to be

class="cmmi-12">a</span><sub><span

      collective goal and where the individual is an agent of one or more of
      these actions.</p></div>
<!--l. 902--><p class="noindent" >This revision narrows the proposal, thereby excluding the sort of counterexample
considered above in section <a 
href="#x1-70006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: section_second_objection --></a>. We do not claim that this revised proposal is the
last word; further narrowing is arguably necessary. But we do claim that the
revised proposal is an improvement over the earlier one, and that the notion of a
collective goal is relevant to explaining what it is for individuals to be agents of
                                                                                

                                                                                
events.
</p><!--l. 910--><p class="indent" >   The issue about what it is for individuals to be agents of events arises where just one
agent is involved, not only when two or more agents are. To illustrate, compare two
cases. In the first case, a single professor twice sends a letter of reference in support of a
particular job applicant. The prospective employer considers these letters.
Although she would not have been sufficiently moved by either letter alone,
the combined impact of the two letters results in her giving the job to this
applicant. The second case is like the first except that the two letters of reference
are sent by different professors. Now consider the event which starts with the
actions and ends with the job offer being made. In both cases it makes sense to
ask whether, in an attenuated sense of agency, the professor or professors are
agents of this event. To make the question vivid it is helpful to introduce a
correspondingly attenuated notion of action: an event with one or more agents is an
action. The question is now whether either of these events, which start with
the letter writings and end with the job offers, is an action in this attenuated
sense.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn11x0" id="fn11x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">11</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-11001f11"></a>
In both cases the answer depends on details not yet specified. If the actions
have a distributive goal only, if there is no collective goal or other form of
coordination involved, then in both cases the answer should be no (for reasons given
above in sections <a 
href="#x1-70006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: section_second_objection --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-90008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: section_distributive_goals --></a>). And if, as we claim, the presence of a collective goal
is necessary for the event to be an action in the second case involving two
professors, then it is also necessary in the first case involving just one. This is
why the notion of a collective goal is not a distinctive ingredient: it applies in
cases involving multiple actions irrespective of whether multiple agents are
involved.
</p><!--l. 929--><p class="indent" >   The discussion so far aimed only to show that the above penultimate definition of
joint action is deflationary. But it also suggests a way in which characterising joint
action depends in part on understanding what it is for individuals to be agents of events
other than actions. This dependence is made explicit in our final attempt to define joint
action:
      </p><div class="quote">
      <!--l. 937--><p class="noindent" >A joint action is an event grounded by two or more agents&#8217; actions
      where all the actions taken together (a) have a collective goal and (b)
      are otherwise related to each other and to the whole event in ways
      sufficient for all and only the agents of these actions to be agents of
      the event.</p></div>
<!--l. 946--><p class="noindent" >Given some background assumptions about agency, this definition plausibly entails that for
an event to be a joint action is for it to be an event with two or more agents. What
distinguishes joint action from action generally is simply the number of agents
                                                                                

                                                                                
involved.
</p><!--l. 949--><p class="indent" >   Does this final definition succeed in characterising a notion of joint action? To show
that it does, we would need to show that it meets the two requirements laid out earlier.
First, it must be central to a tangle of philosophical and scientific questions commonly
taken to be questions about joint action. And, second, an implicit conception of this
notion must be available through reflection on the supposedly paradigm cases from our
opening paragraph.
</p><!--l. 957--><p class="indent" >   On the first point, it is true, of course, that many researchers are concerned with
relatively sophisticated cases of joint action&#8212;cases in which, in addition to our minimal
criteria being met there is also a special kind of commitment, of reasoning, of knowing
interdependence or of subject. Our definition is not intended to capture exactly the
events of interest in any one of these cases. Its purpose is rather to reveal what
unifies otherwise apparently conflicting approaches. The notion captured by our
definition is broad enough to apply to cases from a wide range of studies. To
illustrate, consider two different approaches to joint action in psychology. There is
currently much debate between researchers who focus on behavioural dynamics in
explaining how joint action is possible (e.g.&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmarsh_social_2009">Marsh et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmarsh_social_2009">2009</a> and <a 
href="#Xschmidt_richardons:_2008">Schmidt &amp;
Richardson</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xschmidt_richardons:_2008">2008</a>) and those whose explanations primarily appeal to motor cognition
and representation (e.g.&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSebanz:2005fk">Sebanz et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSebanz:2005fk">2005</a> and <a 
href="#XKnoblich:2006bn">Knoblich &amp; Sebanz</a>&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKnoblich:2006bn">2006</a>). As things
stand, it is sometimes hard to identify the common ground necessary for the two
approaches to be in genuine disagreement. The account of joint action in terms of
collective goals identifies what both approaches can agree on. The substantial
questions concern which types of coordination exist in joint action, and to what
extent characterising any given type of coordination requires appeal to general
dynamical principles or to motor cognition and representational control structures.
A definition of joint action in terms of collective goals, then, is offered not
as something which might resolve controversies about which mechanisms of
coordination make effective joint action possible in different contexts but as a
partial articulation of what those controversies are about and as a building
block for the construction of more substantial accounts. Its value consists in
separating basic conceptual issues about what joint action is from hypotheses
about how joint actions are achieved. To the extent that our definition succeeds
in doing this, it meets the first requirement on identifying a notion of joint
action.
</p><!--l. 986--><p class="indent" >   On the second point&#8212;on whether our definition captures a notion appropriately
related to supposedly paradigm cases&#8212;it is too early to claim complete success. Our
final attempt at a definition (on the preceding page) involves appeal to general
requirements for individuals to be agents of events, in recognition that providing a fully
explicit and entirely adequate definition depends on further progress on large issues in
the philosophy of action. But we do claim that, starting with the simple definition, each
                                                                                

                                                                                
revision moves closer to characterising a notion available through reflection on the
supposedly paradigm cases. Our key conclusions are that the notion of a collective goal
is relevant to any deflationary characterisation of joint action (this is a key ingredient
missing from earlier attempts), and that while further revisions may be necessary, we
have made sufficient progress to justify endorsing modest deflationism about joint
action.

<!--l. 1004--><p class="noindent" >Philosophy of action as currently practiced usually focuses exclusively on cases involving
just one agent. Joint actions are regarded as exotic phenomena with their own,
distinctive philosophical issues. We have argued that this is probably a mistake. Of
course there may be notions of joint action which are genuinely exotic and raise
distinctive philosophical issues. But there is at least one notion of joint action is which
is not like that, or so we have argued. Whether one is concerned with commonsense
thought and talk about action, or with scientific and theoretical questions about action,
the restriction to a single agent is liable to introduce distortions. The truth
may be that individual action, like feline action, is just another case of action.
In theories of action, the number of agents should matter as little as their
felinity.
</p><!--l. 1015--><p class="indent" >   The justification for this claim is the above construction. We have considered how a
notion of joint action can be constructed without appeal to any distinctive
ingredients&#8212;that is, without appeal to any ingredients not already needed for
characterising action generally. The simplest attempts to characterise joint action are
either too narrow, excluding many or all supposedly paradigm cases, or else they are too
broad, failing to identify features central to intuition and science. The notion of a
collective goal enables us to avoid both problems; and it allows us to make sense of the
idea that joint actions can be goal-directed without necessarily involving shared
intention.
</p><!--l. 1025--><p class="indent" >   Nearly all approaches to joint action in philosophy have focussed on shared
intention or related distinctive ingredients. We have argued that there is at
least one notion of joint action in characterising which no such ingredients are
needed. This is incompatible with the claim that all joint actions involve shared
intention.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn12x0" id="fn12x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">12</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-12001f12"></a>
</p><!--l. 1044--><p class="indent" >   Our position is compatible with the view that shared intention or another distinctive
ingredient is needed for characterising some notion of joint action if there is more than
one notion of joint action. Indeed, the notion of a collective goal is relevant to
understanding shared intention in several ways. First, the contents of propositional
attitudes which comprise shared intentions can refer to joint actions involving collective
goals; because collective goals do not constitutively involve shared intentions, this
                                                                                

                                                                                
involves no threat of circularity and raises no issues about well-foundedness.
Second, joint actions involving only collective goals may be proper parts of larger
structures which do involve shared intention, much as (on some views) merely
purposive actions can be components of actions that are intentional in a stronger
sense. Third, collective goals and the associated form of joint action may be
a precursor, in evolution or development (or both), to the potentially more
cognitively and conceptually demanding forms of joint action associated with shared
intention.
</p><!--l. 1052--><p class="indent" >   Notions of joint action on which it is goal-directed but need not involve shared
intention or any other distinctive ingredient have been neglected by philosophers,
perhaps partly because on some views it is tempting to assume that this combination of
features is impossible, and partly because they are (or are thought to be) too simple to
present conceptual puzzles. This is a mistake. To understand the cognitive
bases of abilities to engage in joint action or their evolution or development,
the fact that a conception of joint action presents conceptual puzzles is no
virtue. It may be better to start with the simplest possible notions, such as
those of distributive and collective goal, and use these as building blocks for
constructing narrower categories of joint action as needed by different explanatory
projects.
